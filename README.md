**Project Goals:**
1.Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily select an operation and enter numbers.
2.Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using Python functions.
3.Handle invalid user input, such as division by zero, and display error messages accordingly.
4.Provide a clear and concise output of the calculation result.

**Project Features:**
1.**User Input:** The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation.
2.**Operation Selection:** The user can select one of four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
3.**Calculation:** The program performs the selected operation on the two input numbers.
4.**Error Handling:** The program handles invalid user input, such as division by zero, and displays an error message.
5.**Result Display:** The program displays the result of the calculation in a clear and concise format.

**Technical Requirements:**
1.**Programming Language:** Python 3.x
2.**Development Environment:** Command-line interface (CLI)
3.**Libraries and Modules:** None required
Target Audience:
4.**End-users:** Individuals who need to perform basic arithmetic calculations.
5.**Developers:** Python developers who want to learn how to create a simple command-line application.

**Project Timeline:**
The project is expected to be completed within a short timeframe, approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the complexity of the implementation.
